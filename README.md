## 👨‍💻 Data Projects I've Made:

**[Prophet Currency Trend Prediction](https://github.com/pedrosfarias01/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/1-ProphetCurrencyTrend)**
This app is a valuable tool for making informed decisions about currency exchange, whether for travel, investment, or business purposes. By leveraging advanced time series forecasting with the Prophet library and offering a user-friendly interface via Streamlit, the app enables users to analyze historical trends and predict future exchange rates, helping them choose the best time to buy or sell currency.
